# Ping Pong Game

A simple Ping Pong game implemented using Python's Tkinter library. Players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, keeping score as they play.

## Features

- Two paddles controlled by two players.
- Score tracking for both players.
- Pause and restart functionality.
- Simple and intuitive controls.

## Controls

- **Player 1 (Blue Paddle)**:
  - Move Left: Left Arrow Key (`<Left>`)
  - Move Right: Right Arrow Key (`<Right>`)

- **Player 2 (Green Paddle)**:
  - Move Left: `A` key
  - Move Right: `D` key

- **Game Controls**:
  - Pause/Resume: Click the "Pause" button
  - Restart: Click the "Restart" button

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PingPongGame.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PingPongGame
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python assignment2.py
   ```

## How It Works

The game consists of two main classes: `Paddle` and `Ball`. 

- The `Paddle` class handles the creation and movement of the paddles, along with player scoring.
- The `Ball` class manages the ball's movement, collision detection with paddles and walls, and scoring.

The main function initializes the game window, sets up paddles and the ball, and enters the game loop to update the game state.
